Structuring your web app efficiently is key to making it scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly. Here's a suggested architecture that would be ideal for a web app that processes legal documents and offers insights based on them.

### 1. **Frontend**
The frontend should be user-centric, with a clean and intuitive interface. Since your users will primarily upload contracts and expect the app to flag issues, the interface should be structured around ease of use.

#### **Key Components**:
- **Document Upload Interface:**
  - A section where users can upload Romanian legal documents (PDFs, DOCs, etc.).
  - You can allow users to drag and drop files or use a standard "Browse" button.
  - Consider adding a file format guide for supported types (PDF, DOCX, etc.).
  
- **Contract Summary Section:**
  - After processing the document, this section will display a summary of key contract terms (clauses, dates, parties, etc.).
  - Highlight important information (e.g., parties involved, financial terms, duration, etc.).

- **Flagged Issues Panel:**
  - A section that lists the issues found in the document (e.g., ambiguous clauses, missing important clauses, non-compliance with Romanian legal standards).
  - Each flagged item can be clickable to highlight the corresponding section in the document.
  
- **Document Viewer:**
  - Use a PDF viewer (e.g., **pdf.js**) to display the uploaded document.
  - Implement interactive features like highlighting flagged sections or clauses directly in the document.

- **Risk Score or Summary Insights:**
  - Display a risk score or summary of key findings for the document.
  - Provide clear indicators for issues, such as a color-coded risk system (e.g., green for low risk, yellow for medium, red for high).

- **Recommendations:**
  - Add a section that gives recommendations for fixing flagged issues, such as clarifying ambiguous terms or adding missing clauses.

- **Language Support (Romanian):**
  - Ensure that all UI elements are in Romanian, including buttons, instructions, and error messages.

#### **Tech Stack (Frontend)**:
- **React** (or **Vue.js/Angular**) for the UI framework.
- **pdf.js** for PDF rendering and document interaction.
- **Bootstrap** or **Material UI** for a responsive and polished design.

### 2. **Backend**
The backend is responsible for processing the uploaded legal documents, interacting with the NLP model, and storing the results. A microservice architecture would help with scaling and maintainability.

#### **Key Components**:
- **File Handling Service:**
  - A service dedicated to handling file uploads, checking file formats, and storing them for processing.
  - Use cloud storage services (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage) to store uploaded files securely.

- **Text Extraction Service:**
  - Extract text from PDFs or DOCX files using tools like **PyMuPDF** or **pdfplumber**.
  - For image-based documents, integrate **Tesseract** for OCR to convert the scanned text into machine-readable format.
  - Ensure the service supports Romanian-specific characters and language structure.

- **NLP and Legal Analysis Service:**
  - This service will interact with your fine-tuned NLP models (e.g., LegalBERT or RomanianBERT).
  - The service analyzes the extracted text for legal risks, inconsistencies, and missing clauses.
  - Identify and extract key elements like parties, dates, financial terms, and contractual obligations using named entity recognition (NER).
  
- **Document Analyzer Microservice**:
  - Microservice responsible for running the core contract analysis (checking for ambiguous terms, identifying missing clauses, comparing clauses with legal standards, etc.).
  - Optionally, you can have predefined **legal templates** (for common contract types) to compare the uploaded documents against.

- **Results and Report Generator**:
  - After the analysis is completed, the backend generates a detailed report summarizing the issues and findings.
  - The service can create a downloadable document (e.g., PDF report) for users, containing flagged clauses, the risk score, and recommendations.

#### **Tech Stack (Backend)**:
- **Python** (Django/Flask) for the web framework.
- **FastAPI** (for microservices handling specific tasks like text extraction or document analysis).
- **NLTK/Spacy** for general NLP tasks.
- **Hugging Face Transformers** (for running the Romanian-specific NLP model).
- **Celery** (for handling background tasks like document processing).
- **MongoDB/PostgreSQL** (for storing user data, documents, analysis results).

### 3. **Model Serving (NLP and Legal Models)**
Your model serving layer should handle requests from the backend to run the document through the NLP and legal models. Depending on how you’ve fine-tuned the model, this part should focus on efficiency and scalability.

#### **Key Components**:
- **Model API**:
  - Host your NLP model on a dedicated machine-learning server (e.g., **Hugging Face Hub**, **AWS SageMaker**, or **Google AI Platform**).
  - The model API will handle requests for document analysis and return key information (e.g., detected legal clauses, risky clauses, missing clauses).
  
- **Inference Engine**:
  - The model should be accessible via an API that can take the document’s extracted text as input and return the analysis.
  - You can implement RESTful APIs for handling requests and serving predictions.
  
- **GPU Integration** (optional):
  - Depending on the size and complexity of your model, you might want to integrate GPU acceleration to speed up document processing, especially if you expect a high volume of uploads.

#### **Tech Stack (Model Serving)**:
- **FastAPI** (for serving your machine learning model).
- **Docker** (to containerize your model for easy deployment).
- **NVIDIA GPUs** (optional, for model inference if performance becomes an issue).
  
### 4. **Database and Storage**
You need a robust database and storage solution to store user data, uploaded documents, and the results of the analysis.

#### **Key Components**:
- **Document Storage**:
  - Store the uploaded documents (PDF, DOCX) in a cloud storage service such as **AWS S3** or **Google Cloud Storage**. This ensures scalability and secure access.
  
- **Database for Results**:
  - Store the results of the analysis (risk scores, flagged clauses, and recommendations) in a structured database like **PostgreSQL** or **MongoDB**. This allows for easy querying and retrieval.
  
- **User Management**:
  - Implement user authentication (OAuth, social login options) and store user details in the database.
  - Provide a history of uploaded documents and analyses so users can revisit past results.

#### **Tech Stack (Database and Storage)**:
- **PostgreSQL** or **MongoDB** for structured data (user data, analysis results).
- **Cloud storage (AWS S3/Google Cloud Storage)** for storing uploaded documents.

### 5. **Containerization and Orchestration**
Containerization is critical for easy deployment, scalability, and maintaining isolated environments for different components of the app.

#### **Key Components**:
- **Docker**: 
  - Use Docker containers for isolating each service (e.g., file handling, NLP processing, model serving). This allows for easy scaling and deployment across different environments.
  
- **Kubernetes** (optional for scaling):
  - If you expect high traffic or need to scale different services independently, consider using **Kubernetes** to orchestrate your containerized services.
  
#### **Tech Stack (Containerization and Orchestration)**:
- **Docker** for containerizing each component (frontend, backend, model serving).
- **Kubernetes** (for orchestration, if needed for scaling).
  
### 6. **Security and Compliance**
Since the app will handle sensitive legal documents, security should be a top priority.

#### **Key Components**:
- **Data Encryption**:
  - Encrypt all documents at rest (in storage) and in transit (using HTTPS).
  
- **Access Control**:
  - Implement proper authentication and authorization (OAuth, JWT tokens).
  - Ensure that users can only access their own documents and analysis results.
  
- **Compliance**:
  - Make sure the app complies with **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation), especially when dealing with legal documents and personal data of users in the EU.

### 7. **Optional Features to Enhance UX**
- **Multiple Document Uploads**: Allow users to upload multiple documents and compare contracts side-by-side.
- **Real-time Analysis Progress**: Show the progress of document processing in real time to improve user engagement.
- **Notifications/Email Reports**: Send users the analysis results via email, or notify them when the analysis is ready.

### Conclusion

A good structure for your app would involve breaking it down into containerized microservices, with the core components being:
- **Frontend**: User interface for document upload, viewing, and flagging.
- **Backend**: File handling, text extraction, and NLP processing.
- **Model Serving**: Running your fine-tuned NLP model.
- **Storage**: For document and results storage.
- **Database**: To store user data and analysis results.
- **Security and Compliance**: Encrypt documents, ensure GDPR compliance, and protect user data.

Using containers (e.g., Docker) to structure these components allows for easier deployment, scaling, and maintenance.
